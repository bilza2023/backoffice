Here are some possibilities for extending the functionality of your `DrawLib`:

1.--done **Advanced Shapes**: You can add methods to draw more complex shapes like polygons, stars, and regular polygons with customizable parameters such as number of sides, radius, etc.

2. **Text Manipulation**: Extend text drawing capabilities by adding methods for text alignment, text wrapping, and text formatting (e.g., bold, italic).

3. **Image Manipulation**: Add methods to handle image manipulation such as scaling, rotating, cropping, and applying filters.

4. **Animation**: Integrate animation capabilities by adding methods to animate shapes, texts, and images. This could include transitions, keyframe animations, and easing functions.

5. **Interactive Elements**: Implement interactive elements like buttons, sliders, and input fields on the canvas with event handling for user interactions.

6. **Charts and Graphs**: Create methods for drawing various types of charts and graphs, such as bar charts, line charts, pie charts, and scatter plots.

7. **Layer Management**: Add functionality for managing layers on the canvas, including layer ordering, visibility toggling, and layer-specific transformations.

8. **SVG Import/Export**: Enable importing SVG graphics into the canvas and exporting canvas drawings as SVG files.

9. **Custom Brushes and Effects**: Develop custom brush types (e.g., textured brushes, pattern brushes) and effects (e.g., blur, shadow, glow) for artistic rendering.

10. **Geometry Operations**: Include methods for geometric operations such as intersection detection, distance calculation, and transformation matrices.

These are just some ideas to consider when extending the functionality of your drawing library. Depending on your specific needs and use cases, you can prioritize and implement features that enhance the capabilities of `DrawLib` for your projects.
